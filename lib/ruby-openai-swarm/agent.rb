    # These attributes can be read and written externally. They include:
    # - name: The name of the agent.
    # - model: The model used, e.g., "gpt-4".
    # - resource: Additional custom parameters or data that the agent might need.
    # - noisy_tool_calls: is an array that contains the names of tool calls that should be excluded because they are considered "noise".
    # These tool calls generate irrelevant or unnecessary messages that the agent should not send to OpenAI.
    # When filtering messages, any message that includes these tool calls will be removed from the list, preventing them from being sent to OpenAI.
